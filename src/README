Details about the project
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	# The following program is written in JAVA.                                                                  
	# The program uses bagging with some classifiers to see if there is any performance gain compared to using a single classifier
	# It takes three inputs as command line arguments.
		- "Training" file using which tree will be built.
		- "Testing" used to test the accuracy of decision tree.
		-  Number of bags to be created
		# The entire program uses four java files namely - Attribute.java, Bagging.java, TreeData.java, TrainData.java.
	# The main program resides in the file Bagging.java and that's the starting point of program.
	# Also a sample training file(train.dat) and test file(test.dat) is available in folder and can be used for sample run.

 *  	Operating system : Tested on windows and ubuntu machine
 *  	Assumption : Java path is set
 *
 *		Compilation : javac directory_path\*.java
 *		
 *		Input : file path of train and test data and number of bags to be created as command line arguments
 *		Output : Decision tree identified using train data and accuracy of decision tree for train and test data
 *		Execution: java Bagging "path_of_train_file" "path_of_test_file" Number of iterations
 *		
 *		Example
 *		C:\> java Bagging "D:\Machine Learning\Homework\HW1\Data\train.dat" "D:\Machine Learning\Homework\HW1\Data\test.dat" 50
 *		Accuracy of test file with train data ( 216 instances ) = 82.87
 *		Accuracy of test file with bag data ( 216 instances, 50 bags ) = 93.22
